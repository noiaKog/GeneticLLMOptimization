1. Under 'Data' :
   * raw files
   * positive data combination
   * train - test split for both methods 
   * negative data creation for both methods
3. notebooks:
    * BPE notebook - implementation of masking and fine tune for both methods
    * KMER notebook - implementation of masking and fine tune for both methods
    * WPC genome - notebook - implementation of masking and fine tune for negative metod genome
    * WPC replacement - notebook - implementation of masking and fine tune for negative method replacement
